    <h2><a href="https://github.com/darrenjaworski/js-algorithms/">JS algorithms</a></h2>
    <p>Working through <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/">Algorithms, 4th edition</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844">Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition</a> using Javascript and teaching
      myself all the CS I don't work on in my day job. I'm thinking of expanding this and recreating the data structures and algorithms in Java and Python as well.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bOAEXV-vtFnRP4jIZYFUXn1QA5f3u0QDjdme_s-NmEQ/edit?usp=sharing">Code for OKC D3 Talk</a></h2>
    <p>Quick talk I gave to Code for OKC about D3.js</p>
    <h2><a href="https://github.com/darrenjaworski/coffee-lovers-okc">OKC coffee</a></h2>
    <p>An app to explore coffee shops in Oklahoma City. Designed and built from the ground up to be a hub for coffee people of OKC. However, a lot more work needs to be done on this project. I need to finish collecting data for coffee shops, to develop a suggestion
      system to lead you to the perfect cup in town, and to actually launch the thing. I'll take a couple of weekends and finish this project over a cup of coffee.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://darrenjaworski.github.io/simplestats/">stats made simple</a></h2>
    <p>A series of explainers and tutorials for aspiring statisticians. This is another project that has significantly more work to be done. I'll need two cups of coffee.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/darrenjaworski/">earthquakes in Oklahoma</a></h2>
    <p>I felt an earthquake during lunch. I decided to put a couple of minutes into a <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/darrenjaworski/eeeb26283484184984e3">series</a> of <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/darrenjaworski/caf09001e2812c4e388e">maps</a> and <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/darrenjaworski/23cbba3bfbe564113fbc">charts</a> that
      touch on the swarm of induced earthquakes in Oklahoma. <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/darrenjaworski/">(Even more.)</a> Each visualization is updated with real-time earthquake data. I will include more data layers as they become available.</p>
    <h2><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/darrenjaworski/f2540e53c4e327a145d0">legislature voting trends</a></h2>
    <p>Similarity matrix of the 2015 Oklahoma Legislature voting trends. This small project basically answers the question: which legislators vote like each other?</p>
